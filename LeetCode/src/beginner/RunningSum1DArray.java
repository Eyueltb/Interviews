 * 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array(Easy)
 * Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
 * Return the running sum of nums.
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [1,3,6,10]
 * Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
 * Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
 * Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
 *
 * Related Topics - Array, Prefix Sum
 * Hint- Think about how we can calculate the i-th number in the running sum from the (i-1)-th number.
 *
 * Solution
 * Approach 1: Using Separate Space
 * Intuition
 *
 * We are required to find the running sum of numbers nums[i] in the input array where i ranges from 0 to n-1 and n is the size of the input array. We can see that the running sum is the sum of all of the elements from index 0 to index i inclusive. Since we start building our output array at index 0, at each index i we have already calculated the sum of all numbers up to and including index i-1. Thus, instead of recalculating the sum, we can get the result for index i by simply adding the element at index i to the previously calculated running sum for index i-1.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *
 * Define an array result.
 * Initialize the first element of result with the first element of the input array.
 * At index i append the sum of the element nums[i] and previous running sum result[i - 1] to the result array.
 * We repeat step 3 for all indices from 1 to n-1.
 *
 * class Solution {
 * public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
 *         int[] result = new int[nums.length];
 *
 *         // Initialize first element of result array with first element in nums.
 *         result[0] = nums[0];
 *         for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
 *             // Result at index `i` is sum of result at `i-1` and element at `i`.
 *             result[i] = result[i - 1] + nums[i];
 *         }
 *         return result;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Complexity Analysis
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n) where nn is the length of the input array.
 * This is because we use a single loop that iterates over the entire array to calculate the running sum.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(1) since we don't use any additional space to find the running sum.
 * Note that we do not take into consideration the space occupied by the output array.
 *
 *
 * Approach 2: Using Input Array for Output
 * Intuition
 *
 * In the previous approach we created an extra array to store our results.
 * However, we do not actually need to do so. We can obtain the same result without using extra space by performing the same operations on the input array instead.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *
 * Increase nums[i] by the previous index's running sum.
 * The previous index's running sum is stored at index i-1 in the input array.
 * We repeat step 1 for all indices from 1 to n-1.
 *
 * class Solution {
 * public int[] runningSum(int[] nums) {
 *         for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
 *             // Result at index `i` is sum of result at `i-1` and element at `i`.
 *             nums[i] += nums[i - 1];
 *         }
 *         return nums;
 *     }
 * }
 * Complexity Analysis
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n)O(n) where nn is the length of input array.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(1)O(1) since we don't use any additional space to find the running sum. Note that we do not take into consideration the space occupied by the output array.
